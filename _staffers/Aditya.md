Hello everyone! I am Aditya in my 2nd year of my MS in CS, originally from Pune, India. This is my 2nd time as a TA for DSC 106 and I look forward to making this an engaging and enjoyable class for you all. Fun fact: I love the German language, and have written and acted in German plays (won a few awards too!)
Please feel free to ask me any questions about the course material, or even just to chat! I'm here to help make this a valuable learning experience.
