Hello, I am Shaokang Jiang, a second-year master's student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am happy to meet with all of you this quarter. I believe DSC 106 will be immensely valuable in refining your ability to represent data effectively to external audiences and in discovering the hidden potential within datasets. I hope you thoroughly enjoy the course and find it both engaging and beneficial.
