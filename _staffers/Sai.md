Hello everyone! My name is Sai, and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics here in San Diego. My professional aspiration is to excel in the field of Business Data Science, where I have a particular interest in developing applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). I welcome any exciting use case discussions related to LLMs! Before my journey here, I gained experience as a software developer, focusing mainly on front-end development.

Outside my academic pursuits, I'm an avid sports fan. I passionately follow football, with Real Madrid as my favorite team, and I'm a fan of Djokovic in tennis and Kohli in cricket. Balancing my love for sports with my master's studies is challenging, but I always find time to stay updated.

As your teaching assistant for this course, I'm excited to meet all of you. I'm looking forward to a great learning experience where we can share knowledge and insights. Let's make this journey an enriching one together!
