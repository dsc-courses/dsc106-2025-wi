## Introduction

Labs and projects in DSC 106 are mostly coding assignments, so it's important to
make sure that your computing environment is set up properly. You will need
`Git`, `VSCode`, and `Node` to complete all labs and projects.

---

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

All of our course materials, including your assignments, are hosted on GitHub
in [this Git repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-wi25). This
means that you'll need to download and use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to work
with the course materials.

Git is a _version control system_. In short, it is used to keep track of
the history of a project. With Git, you can go back in time to any
previous version of your project, or even work on two different versions
(or \"branches\") in parallel and \"merge\" them together at some point
in the future. We\'ll stick to using the basic features of Git in DSC 106.

There are Git GUIs, and you can use them for this class. You can also
use the command-line version of Git. To get started, you\'ll need to
\"clone\" the course repository. The command to do this is:

    git clone https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-wi25

This will copy the repository to a directory on your computer. To bring in the
latest version of the repository, run **`git pull`** in your local repository.
This will **not** overwrite your work. In fact, Git is designed to make it very
difficult to lose work (although it\'s still possible!).

**Merge Conflicts**

You might face issues when using `git pull` regarding merge issues and branches.
This is caused by files being updated on your side while we are also changing
the [Git repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-wi25) by pushing new
assignments on our side. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve it:

NOTE: Whenever working with GitHub pulls, merges, etc., it's a good idea to save
your important work locally so that if you accidentally overwrite your files you
still have the work saved. **Save your work locally before following the steps
below.**

1. `git status` shows the current state of your Git working directory and
   staging area. It's a good sanity check to start with. You will probably see
   your project and lab files that you have worked on.
2. `git add .` will add all your files to be ready to commit.
3. `git commit -m "some message of your choice"` will commit the files, with
   some description in the quotations. This can be whatever you want, it won't
   matter.

At this stage, if you `git pull`, it should work. You should double-check that
you have new files, as well as that your old files are unchanged. If they are
changed then you should be able to just copy-paste from your local backup. If
this does **not** work then you may have **merge conflicts**, follow the next
steps:

4. `git checkout --theirs [FILENAME]` will tell git that whenever a conflict
   occurs in `[FILENAME]` to keep your version. Run this for each file with a
   conflict.
5. `git add [FILENAME]` to mark each file with a conflict as resolved.
6. `git rebase --continue` or `git merge`, depending on the setup.

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To create, write, and edit our code, we are going to use a code editor. For this
class, we are going to provide support for VS Code. If you want to use another
code editor, feel free to do so, but keep in mind that we may not be able to
recreate the problems that you may run into. You may download VS Code from
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

<!-- In order to make our lives easier when we develop websites, we are going to use
some VS Code extensions. Up to lab 6, it is only necessary to install the
following two extensions. Come back when you need to work on lab 6; more
information (related to `Node` installation) will be updated.

### [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

This is an extension that will help us keep our code clean and tidy. Click
"Install" on the
[webpage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click "Install" again to install the
extension.

### [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)

This will host a local server in our workspace for us to preview our web pages
on. Click "Install" on the
[webpage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).
It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click "Install" again to install the
extension.

### [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)

Starting Lab4, you are going to use Svelte. This will help you with svelte
components. Click "Install" on the
[webpage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).
It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click "Install" again to install the
extension.

## Node.js and npm

Again, for Lab 4, we are going to need node.js and npm. Node.js is an
open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes
JavaScript code outside of a web browser. NPM ‚Äì or "Node Package Manager" ‚Äì is
the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime Node.js. You may find
detailed instructions to download and install them
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).

To check the Node version, open a command prompt and type:

```bash
node --version
```

To check the npm version, type in:

```bash
npm --version
```

If everything is installed correctly, you should see the version number
information.

## Generate static site using svelte SSG

To assist you in creating a static webpage for GitHub Pages using Svelte, we
have developed a template for you: [ShaokangJiang/svelte-template
(github.com)](https://github.com/ShaokangJiang/svelte-template).

Please follow the link provided, and initiate the creation of a new repository.

![image-20240210175403813](./assets/image-20240210175403813.png)

After GitHub completes the cloning process, navigate to the settings page. On
the left panel, under the "Pages" tab, locate the "Source" section and select
"GitHub Actions" as the source.

Clone this repository and proceed with your work. Upon completion, commit and
push your changes. The corresponding GitHub Actions will then execute, building
a static website hosted at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name` for
you.

### Migrate from your project

If you have started on the project and want to switch to using this template,
you can copy your `src` folder, go to the local clone of your version of this
template, then paste it. When it says the file exists, simply click replace, and
you can continue working on your version of this template. -->
