# 👩‍🔬 Programming Labs

The weekly programming labs will help you get up to speed with the fundamentals
of front-end web development and then will give you more hands-on practice with
the tech stack for developing dynamic web-based visualization.

These materials were primarily developed by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/).
