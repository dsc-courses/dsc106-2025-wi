Seems familiar? This is what version control frees you from! (Source: PhD Comics) . Setting up Git . The first step is to check if you already have git installed by opening the terminal and typing git --version. | If you get an error about the command being unknown, you need to install Git on your computer. | If you get a version number, you already have git installed. Make sure it‚Äôs up to date by comparing the version number you got with the one on the official website. If it‚Äôs significantly out of date, it‚Äôs a good practice to update it, covered at the end of the installation guide. | . If you‚Äôve never used git before, first you need to set up your name and email. Run the following commands to let git know your name and email address. Open a terminal and run: . git config --global user.name \"Your Name\" git config --global user.email \"your_email@mit.edu\" . Git concepts: repo(sitory), staging area, commit . In Git, code is grouped in repositories (or repos for short), which are the root directories of a project. Repositories cannot be nested. Git tracks changes via the concept of a commit, which is a set of changes to the code. By combining the commits from the start (the commit history) together, it can give us a snapshot of the code at any point in time. A commit is performed in two steps: . | We tell Git which files we want to commit by adding them to the staging area through git add. We can add multiple files at once, or one by one. | We tell Git to commit the files in the staging area through git commit. | . Let‚Äôs try it out! . Create a new folder on your computer (e.g. lab-0) and open it in VSCode. Then create a text file called hello.txt and write something in it. Then, open the built-in terminal in VS Code and type: . git init . Then press Enter. You should see something like: . Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/username/Documents/viz-society/lab-0/.git/ . This means that Git has created a new repository in the current folder, but we have not yet committed anything. To see what the current status of the repository is, type: . git status . Which should give you something like: . On branch main No commits yet Untracked files: (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed) hello.txt nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) . To add all the files in the current folder to the staging area, type: . git add . The . means ‚Äúthe current folder‚Äù and is used very widely (similarly, .. means ‚Äúthe parent folder‚Äù). Now, if we check the status again, we should see: . On branch main No commits yet Changes to be committed: (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage) new file: hello.txt . This means that the file hello.txt is now in the staging area, and will be committed when we tell Git to do so. Let‚Äôs commit it: . git commit -m \"Add hello.txt\" . The -m flag means that we are providing a message for the commit inline. If we don‚Äôt provide it, Git will open a text editor for us to write the message in. That‚Äôs it! We have now committed our first change to the repository. You can see recent changes via git log and even go back to a previous commit by using git checkout &lt;commit hash&gt; (the commit hash is the long string of letters and numbers that you see in the output of git log).

    "title": "  Part 2: Creating our own website from scratch and publishing it on the Web ",
    "content": ". Step 1: Setup . Creating a new repostory with GitHub Desktop and publishing it to GitHub . | Create a new repository with GitHub Desktop called portfolio (or anything else you want, but the rest will assume portfolio) | Publish it on GitHub (verify that it worked by visiting https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio or clicking Repository &gt; View on GitHub in GitHub Desktop‚Äôs menu) | Open it on Visual Studio Code (Menu: Repository &gt; Open in Visual Studio Code) | . Step 2: Create a basic HTML page . Our initial HTML page is pretty simple. | Create a new file called index.html in the root of your repository | Type ! and hit Tab to expand the Emmet snippet into a basic HTML page | Change the page title (&lt;title&gt;) to ‚ÄúYOUR_NAME: Personal site and portfolio‚Äù | Add a &lt;h1&gt; with your name | Add a &lt;p&gt; with a short description of yourself (if you can‚Äôt think of anything, just type lorem and hit Tab to generate placeholder text; just make sure to edit it later!) | Save the file. Open the file in Chrome and verify that it works. | Commit and push your changes to GitHub | . Remember that committing and pushing your changes to GitHub is a two-step process: First, you commit your changes to your local repository: then you push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub. Step 3: Publish your site on GitHub Pages . Our simple page is now live! GitHub provides a free hosting service called GitHub Pages that is perfect for hosting static websites like the one we are creating. It gives you a URL like https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME that you can share with anyone to show them your site, but you can also use your own domain name if you have one. | Open your repository on GitHub (On GitHub Desktop: Repository &gt; View on GitHub) | Click Settings | Scroll down and click the section | Select ‚Äúmain‚Äù as the branch and click Save | Check ‚ÄúEnforce HTTPS‚Äù | Wait a few seconds for GitHub to publish your site, then refresh. Then click to open your site in a new tab. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî your website is now live! üéâ | . Selecting main as the branch . In the following steps, it is implied that you first test your changes locally in Chrome, then commit and push them to GitHub, and then refresh your site to verify that the changes are live (after waiting a few seconds). Step 4: Add a photo . | Create an images folder in the root of your repository | Find a photo of yourself (or anything else you want) and save it in the images folder | Add an &lt;img&gt; element to your HTML page, with the src attribute set to the path to your image file (images/your-image-file-name.jpg) | Add an alt attribute to the &lt;img&gt; element with a short description of the image as you would describe it to someone who cannot see it. | . Our page now has a photo! Step 5: Add a CSS stylesheet . | Create a new file called style.css in the root of your repository | Add the following CSS to the file: body { /* Set line height to 1.5 times the font size and use the OS‚Äôs UI font as the website font */ font: 100%/1.5 system-ui; } . | Link the stylesheet to your HTML page via a &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt;. | . Step 6: Add more pages and a navigation menu . | Create two new files: projects/index.html and contact/index.html. | Set their title and add a &lt;h1&gt; with the page title in each. | Add a navigation menu in each page (using &lt;nav&gt;), with links (using &lt;a&gt;) to every page in your site, including the current one. | Add a link to your GitHub profile to the navigation menu with target=\"_blank\" to make it always open in a new tab. | . The directory structure at this point should look a bit like this: . \" alt=\"\" style=\"--natural-width:404;--natural-height:267;background-blend-mode:normal!important;background-clip:content-box!important;background-position:50% 50%!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)!important;background-image:var(--sf-img-13)!important;background-size:100% 100%!important;background-origin:content-box!important;background-repeat:no-repeat!important\"> . When linking to other pages in the same site, you should use relative URLs. Why do we use index.html? In most web servers, index.html is a special name that is used as the default file to serve when the user visits a directory. This means that users can type https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/contact/ instead of https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/contact/index.html. Step 7: Basic contact form . In this step we will add a functional contact form to the contact page. When the user submits the form, their email client will open with a new email to you, with the subject and body prefilled with the values they entered in the form. Contact forms on the web are not made like this anymore, and for good reasons: . | This method exposes your email address to spammers. One of the primary reasons for a contact form is to not expose your email address publicly. | The message formatting is awkward and not very user-friendly. | . However, making a contact form properly would require server-side code and/or a third-party service, which is way beyond the scope of this first lab. | Create a &lt;form&gt; element in contact/index.html and set: . | Its action attribute to mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS (e.g. mailto:foo@example.com) | Its method attribute to POST | Its enctype attribute to text/plain | Why do we need the last two? Experiment by using the form without them and see what happens! | . | Create our contact form fields. We need at least: . | A single line text field (&lt;input&gt;) for the sender‚Äôs email address with name=\"email\" and type=\"email\" | A single line text field (&lt;input&gt;) for for the subject with name=\"subject\" (you don‚Äôt need type=\"text\" as that is the default) | A multiline text field (&lt;textarea&gt;) for the actual message with name=\"body\" | . | Wrap each field in a &lt;label&gt; with the field name as its contents | Add a submit button with &lt;button&gt; (you don‚Äôt need type=\"submit\" as that is the default) | . The directory structure at this point should look a bit like this: . \" alt=\"\" style=\"--natural-width:404;--natural-height:267;background-blend-mode:normal!important;background-clip:content-box!important;background-position:50% 50%!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)!important;background-image:var(--sf-img-13)!important;background-size:100% 100%!important;background-origin:content-box!important;background-repeat:no-repeat!important\"> . While developing, you will likely need to try your form multiple times. Add default values to all fields via the HTML (using the value attribute on &lt;input&gt;s and element contents in &lt;textarea&gt;) so you don‚Äôt have to type them every time. Our contact form should now be functional albeit not very pretty (but don‚Äôt worry about that, that‚Äôs CSS‚Äô job). An example contact form for Step 7. Try submitting it and see what happens! . Don‚Äôt worry about the appearance of your contact form, we will fix that in Lab 2! While it can be tempting, do not use tables to lay your form out in a grid with the form labels next to the form fields. Remember that HTML describes content, not presentation, and tables are for tabular data, not layout. We will see how to use CSS to lay our form out in a grid in Lab 2. Step 8: Adding a CV/resume page . This is a more freeform step, with the goal of getting you to explore HTML on your own and experiment. Add a new page to your website (and link to it from the navigation menu) that contains your CV or resume. If you do not want to publish your CV on the Web for privacy reasons, you can use fake data for all or part of it. In that case, try to keep the structure as close as possible to your real CV and simply change the actual data (e.g. names, dates, places) so that you are still solving a realistic use case. Structure the different sections of content with &lt;section&gt; elements. Think of &lt;section&gt; as the units of content that you would list in a table of contents for that page (which is exactly how they are exposed to assistive technology users). You may also find &lt;article&gt; useful for structuring independent, self-contained units of content (‚Äúarticle‚Äù as in ‚Äúarticle of clothing‚Äù not ‚Äúnewspaper article‚Äù ‚Äî yes, it is confusing!). Elements you will need (excluding those outside &lt;body&gt;): . | Headings, paragraphs, lists | &lt;a&gt; for links | &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; (see above) | &lt;time&gt; for dates | . Elements you may need: . | &lt;header&gt; for &lt;section&gt; or &lt;article&gt; headers that are more than just a heading | &lt;img&gt; in case you want to include icons or logos of organizations | . Don‚Äôt forget to preview your changes locally first, then when you‚Äôre happy with them commit and push to GitHub. ",

The first visualization should be designed to clearly and sincerely convey insights from the data. In contrast, the second should be crafted to intentionally mislead the viewer, causing them to make incorrect inferences. Additionally, you are required to write a brief explanation, limited to four paragraphs, outlining your design strategy for both visualizations. In this task, an earnest visualization is defined as one that: . | Is easily understandable and can be interpreted by the general public. | Uses visual encodings that are suitable and effective for the desired purpose. | Clearly and openly describes any transformations made to the data. | Transparently communicates the source of the data and any possible biases involved. | . Conversely, a deceptive visualization typically displays these characteristics: . | The graphical depiction is deliberately unsuitable or deceptive. | Headings are crafted to influence the viewer‚Äôs understanding in a biased manner. | There is intentional manipulation or selective filtering of data to deceive. | It‚Äôs not transparent about possible bias present in the data. | . For the earnest visualization, your goal is to be as clear and transparent as possible to help viewers answer your intended question. For the deceptive visualization, your goal is to trick the viewer (including the course staff!) into believing that the visualization is legitimate and earnest. It should not be immediately obvious which visualization is trying to be deceptive. Subtle ineffective choices in the design should require close and careful reading to be identified. For the deceptive visualization, misleading strategies are fine but outright lying is not. For example, sketchy, unreliable or untrustworthy input datasets are discouraged, but misleading omission, filtering, or transformation of trustworthy data records is fine. Deliberate lies in the title, axes, labels, or annotations is discouraged, but technically true/relevant but otherwise misleading text in the visualization is fine. For both visualization designs, start by choosing a question you would like to answer. Design your visualization to answer that question either correctly (for the earnest visualization) or incorrectly (for the deceptive visualization). You may choose to address a different question with each visualization. Be sure to document the question as part of the visualization design (e.g., title, subtitle, or caption) and in your assignment write-up. Your write-up should contain the following information: . | The specific question each visualization aims to answer. | A description of your design rationale and important considerations for each visualization. | .

Note what you discover and learn about the data set, and what properties lead you to a particular conclusion. You must identify which visualization you believe to be intentionally deceptive, along with a rationale indicating which design elements led you to this conclusion. Next, author constructive critiques for each visualization design. Consider the following concerns: . | Are expressive and effective visual encodings applied? | How well does the choice of encodings they reveal the most important features or trends of the underlying data? | Is critical data easily seen, or is it somehow hidden? | Is an audience likely to understand the visualization? | How clear and transparent is the design? | Are elements appropriately titled or labeled? | Is there appropriate spacing, layout, legible type, and other forms of design styling? | Is the overall display confusing or cluttered? | Is there important information missing that is needed to interpret the visualization approapriately? | . To share critique, we will use the ‚ÄúI like / I wish / What if?‚Äù format.

    "content": "For this assignment, you will explore the issues involved in implementing interactive visualizations. You will build a visualization that enables interactive exploration of a dataset of your choosing (we do have some suggestions as well which you can find below) and deploy it on the web. One goal of this assignment is to gain familiarity with implementing interaction techniques for visualizations. For example, the zipdecode and NameGrapher applications apply the interactive technique of dynamic queries ‚Äì as explored in the earlier HomeFinder application ‚Äì to the problem of uncovering patterns in zip codes and baby names. Similarly, treemaps were originally developed to display hierarchical file structures and were later adapted to the problem of interactively depicting a map of the stock market. We have seen many other examples of interactive visualization techniques in class. The goal of this assignment is not only for you to gain hands-on implementation experience, but also for you to think about the effectiveness of the specific techniques for your chosen data domain. One challenge is to scope the assignment so that you can finish it within two weeks. Focus on designing a limited yet compelling visualization that enables interactive exploration along a few critical dimensions. The NameGrapher application is a nice example that uses a simple but elegant interaction design to enable engaging explorations. A tightly focused, well-implemented interactive graphic is much preferred to a sprawling design that attempts too much! . ",

To determine what subset of the data and which interactive options are most promising, you may want to perform additional exploratory analysis. What aspects of the data reveal the most interesting discoveries or stories? Do not feel obligated to try to convey everything about the data: focus on a compelling subset. Your graphic must include interactions that enable exploration. Possible techniques include panning, zooming, brushing, details-on-demand (e.g., tooltips), dynamic query filters, and selecting different measures to display. You are free to also consider highlights, annotations, or other narrative features intended to draw attention to particular items of interest and provide additional context. Implement your interactive graphic and deploy it to the web. You may only use only D3.js for this project. Vega-lite/Plotly/Altair/any other high-level plotting library or tool are strictly not allowed for this project. You can use other non-plotting related JavaScript libraries, e.g. Lodash, Svelte, Moment, etc. Your graphic should not require customized server-side support; you should simply load data from a static data file or public web API. Please refer to the Tech Support page for instructions on deploying a GitHub Pages website using Svelte. For deploying websites with other libraries, feel free to explore on your own. Using our template to complete this project is not mandatory. You will use GitHub pages to host your visualization from your project repository. Make sure that you make your repository ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù. We recommend keeping everything (development files and website) in your master branch: either serve your website from the root folder or the ‚Äú/docs‚Äù folder. Your repo must also contain the (unobfuscated) source code for your visualization.

How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices? . | An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)?

(+3 points) | The visualization does not violate the expressiveness criteria, but another set of design choices (marks and encoding channels) could have been more effective (e.g. using the area visual channel instead of position when possible). (+2.5 points) | The visualization violates the expressiveness criteria (e.g. heavy overplotting, encodings that imply incorrect readings, etc.), and these violations are not addressed using the available interactions (e.g. overplotting that cannot be filtered or zoomed into). (+1.5 points) | . | Data Transformations | ¬† | The visualization uses appropriate data transformations (e.g. filtering, aggregating) and clearly describes the transformations to the reader (e.g. in the subtitle of the plot). (+1.5 points) | The visualization used an inappropriate set of data transformations (e.g. filtering out important outliers), or did not clearly describe these transformations to the reader. (+1 point) | . | Interaction | The interactive elements of the plot are polished, mostly bug-free, and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data. (+3.5 points) | The interactive elements of the plot are functional and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data, but a static plot (perhaps with a different encoding) could have conveyed the same information just as effectively. (+3 points) | The plot would have been substantially more effective as a static plot without the interaction; or, the interaction has major bugs that preclude use.

It also contains an overview of the team‚Äôs development process. (+2 points) | One or more required elements of the writeup has major issues (e.g. rationale misses important parts of the visualization design) or is missing.

Data on Energy by Our World in Data, 1900-2022 . Our World in Data, a non-profit that gathers and analyzes data about global issues, has published data about energy usage for countries (e.g. coal consumption, hydropower consumption, etc.) around the world since 1900. You can download the data here. Education Data . Every year, the federal government releases large amounts of data on US schools, districts, and colleges. However, this information is scattered across multiple datasets. Urban Institute‚Äôs Education Data Explorer tries to fix this issue by putting together data from various sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics‚Äô Common Core of Data (CCD), the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the US Department of Education‚Äôs EDFacts, and IPUMS‚Äô National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) and makes it available as an API. You can download the data by making an API call using the code available on the website or alternatively clicking on the downloads button on the website. Internet Usage Data . UNdata brings international statistical databases within easy reach of users through a single-entry point. It is maintained by the Development Data Section of the Development Data and Outreach Branch within the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) of the UN Secretariat. You can find the internet usage data here. Feel free to take a look at some of the other datasets made available by UNdata here. This data has the following columns: . | Region/country Code: code representing the country or region. | Region or Country Name: Field containing the country name. | Year: Field containing the year at which the data was collected. | Value: Field denoting the Percentage of individuals using the internet. | Source: Field denoting the source of the data. | .

    "content": "Lectures . Lectures will be held in-person on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30-4:50PM in [CENTR 115] and 5:00-6:20PM in [CENTR 119]. Lecture attendance is not strictly required, but is one option for earning your participation grade (detailed below). Lectures will be podcasted, and lecture slides will be posted before class. Participation . Developing expertise in data visualization also means being able to clearly communicate, critique, and explain data visualizations to others. To develop this skill, participation in class will count for 8% of your course grade. Each week of the course will count for 1% of your grade, and the lowest two weeks will be dropped. There are 3 options for fulfilling the participation expectations for a particular week: . | Attend both lectures and participate in the lecture exercises. Participation will be tracked using an online form given during class. | Share and critique at least 1 interesting data visualization on Ed under the Critiques category that hasn‚Äôt already been shared during class, labs, or projects. To receive credit, the critique needs to have at least 3 paragraphs of around 3-4 sentences each. The three paragraphs should: . | Summarize the visualization and describe how it connects to a lecture concept from the current week or the previous week. If a dataset for the visualization is publicly available, provide a link. | Describe the strengths of this particular visualization. | Describe the weaknesses of this particular visualization. | . | Respond to 2 different visualization critiques from other students on Ed under the Critiques category. To receive credit, each response needs to have at least 2 paragraphs of around 3-4 sentences each. The paragraphs should: . | Explain what parts of the critique you agree and disagree with. | Suggest an improvement for the visualization. You can sketch out your improved visualization or write a program to generate it. | . | . ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you choose to fulfill lecture participation through option 2 or 3, you must make a public post on EdStem under the Critiques category. In the title of your post or response, clearly state that it is being used as an opportunity to fulfill lecture participation. The deadline for submitting critiques to count for the corresponding week is Sunday at 11:59 PM. Discussions . We will not be using the scheduled discussion sections for this course. We encourage you to attend office hours instead. Labs . There will be 7 lab assignments due weekly throughout the quarter. Each lab assignment is designed to be a walkthrough of practical material that you will use for your projects. Labs are meant to serve as worked examples: the solution code will be given to you as part of the lab. To receive credit for labs, you will need to complete the lab and then get checked off during office hours by a TA. The check off requirements will be clearly described at the end of each lab assignment. Each lab is worth 2% of your final grade, and the lowest lab grade will be dropped. Labs will be released on Fridays and due on the following Fridays at 11:59PM. You will access labs by pulling the course GitHub repository. Projects . There will be 4 projects due throughout the quarter. The projects are open-ended and are the primary focus of the course. As such, our standards for grading will be similar to the way portfolio pieces are evaluated for internship/research lab/job applications ‚Äî we expect your best work! The first three projects are solo projects. For the final project, you may work in pairs. Working in Pairs . You may work together on the final project (and only the final project!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level. In particular, you cannot split up the project and each work on separate parts independently. If you work with a partner: . | Only one partner needs to submit the project on Gradescope; this partner should add the other partner to their submission. | You and your partner will receive the same score on any submissions you make together. | . If you are unhappy with your partnership (e.g., if your partner does not keep in touch, does not come prepared to work on the assignment, or does not seem to be engaged in the process), please first address your concerns to your partner, and try to agree on what should be done to make the partnership work well for both of you. If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to the instructors, who will work with you and your partner to improve the situation. Note that you may not work with partners on lab assignments, however you‚Äôre encouraged to discuss all assignments with others at a conceptual level in office hours and study groups. Office Hours . To get help on assignments and concepts, course staff will be hosting several office hours per week. The majority of our office hours are held in-person, though a few are held remotely ‚Äì if you‚Äôre able to, you‚Äôre strongly encouraged to attend in-person. See the Calendar tab of the course website for the most up-to-date schedule and instructions. Weekly Schedule . To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly schedule (which is subject to change in any given week): . | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | . | ¬† | ¬† | Lecture | ¬† | Lecture | ¬† | ¬† | . | ¬† | ¬† | ¬† | ¬† | ¬† | Lab and Project due | ¬† | .

    "content": "Grading . Here is how we‚Äôll compute your grade: . | Component | Weight | Notes | . | Participation | 8% | 1% per week, 2 lowest weeks dropped | . | Labs | 12% | 2% per lab, 1 lowest lab dropped | . | Project 1 | 10% | ¬† | . | Project 2 | 15% | 10% for submission, 5% for peer review | . | Project 3 | 15% | 10% for submission, 5% for peer review | . | Final Project | 40% | 3% for proposal, 7% prototype, 15% video, 15% final submission | . Late Policy, Slip Days, and Drops . All assignments must be submitted by 11:59PM San Diego time on the due date to be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it‚Äôs a good habit to submit early and often. If you make a submission after the deadline, your assignment will be counted as late. You have 6 ‚Äúslip days‚Äù to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the deadline of an assignment by 24 hours. The number of slip days you can use on an assignment depends on the kind of assignment: . | On labs, you may use up to 1 slip day. Since labs are due on Fridays and require a TA to check off, you may get checked off on the following Monday after a lab deadline to use 1 slip day. | On projects, you may use up to 2 slip days. Projects will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the deadline. Note that you will not be able to use slip days on the Final Project Deliverables due on Saturday, March 16, 2024. | . Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slip days are also meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your assignment. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably should not need to use all 6, but if you have something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work something out. Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don‚Äôt need to ask in order to use one. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep track of how many you have left. If you‚Äôve run out of slip days and submit an assignment late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you use all 6 days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip days first to your projects (in chronological order), then to your labs (in chronological order), and then to other assignments. This is done to prevent you from receiving a 0 on, say, Project 4, if you‚Äôve used all of your slip days on labs up until that point; in such a case, you‚Äôd instead receive a 0 on an earlier lab that isn‚Äôt weighted as much in your grade. Regrade Requests . If you feel that there in an error in grading, you may submit a regrade request within two days of the grades being released. If you do not submit a regrade request within two days, your original grade will be final. To submit a regrade request for a manually graded problem, make the regrade request directly on Gradescope. Note that part of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be eligible for full credit. Incompletes . In the unfortunate circumstance that you become sick, suffer a loss, or otherwise experience a significant setback that is outside of your control, you may be eligible for an Incomplete grade, which allows you to complete the rest of the work at a later time. If you are experiencing challenges due to circumstances outside your control, please contact me ASAP and we can discuss the best course of action. Note that an Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed, only to do work that hasn‚Äôt been completed, so it‚Äôs best to reach out right away. A note on letter grades . The following is adapted from CSE 160 at the University of Washington. Grading for this class is not curved in the sense that the average is set at (say) a B+ and half of the class must receive a grade lower than that. If everyone does well and shows mastery of the material, everyone can receive an A (this would be awesome!). If no one does well (this is unlikely), then everyone can receive a C. Grading for this class is curved in the sense that we do not have a pre-defined mapping from project and exam scores to a final GPA. There is no pre-determined score (e.g., 90% of all possible points) that earns an A or a B or a C or any other grade. To determine the final grade, we will ask questions like ‚ÄúDid this student master the material?‚Äù. With that said, grades will not be any stricter than the standard grading scale (where an A+ is a 97+, A is 93+, A- is 90+, etc). For instance, the threshold for an ‚ÄúA‚Äù will never be higher than 93%. Try your best not to worry about grades, and we‚Äôll reciprocate by being fair. We‚Äôre in this together üòé. ",

    "content": "DSC 106 is known for being a rigorous but rewarding course. While you will be challenged this quarter, we will be offering you plenty of support through office hours and Ed. Make good use of these resources, and you will be able to succeed in this course. There is no excuse for cheating in this course. If you do cheat, we will enforce the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that by taking this course, their assignments may be submitted to third-party software to help detect plagiarism. Why is academic integrity important? . Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone‚Äôs work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades (and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for the the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD! . The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations. What counts as cheating? . In DSC 106, you can read books, surf the web, get inspiration from previous work or AI tools like ChatGPT, talk to your friends and the DSC 106 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, all code must be written by you (or, in the instance of projects, together with your partner). The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed (not an exhaustive list): . | Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except from your pair programming partner during projects), the web, or any other resource not officially sanctioned by this course | Posting your code online, including on Ed, unless privately to instructors only | Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf | Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else | Providing code to any other student in the course | Splitting up project questions with your pair programming partner and each working on different questions | . The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are allowed in (not an exhaustive list): . | (new) Using AI code generation tools, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, to help write your code | Discussing the general approach to solving labs or projects | Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them | Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken the exam after the exam is complete | Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading or video, with attribution | Using Google to search for documentation. | Working together with other students on assignments without copying or sharing answers | Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Ed, without sharing your code | . How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating? . The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement and remembering to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage. Here are some suggestions for completing your work: . | Don‚Äôt look at or discuss the details of another student‚Äôs code for an assignment you are working on, and don‚Äôt let another student look at your code. | Don‚Äôt start with someone else‚Äôs code and make changes to it, or in any way share code with other students. | If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don‚Äôt take notes, and wait an hour afterward before you write any code. | .

    "content": "Labs and projects in DSC 106 are mostly coding assignments, so it‚Äôs important to make sure that your computing environment is set up properly. You will need to use DataHub for the first lab. You will need Git, VSCode, and Node to complete all other labs and projects. Git . All of our course materials, including your assignments, are hosted on GitHub in this Git repository. This means that you‚Äôll need to download and use Git to work with the course materials. Git is a version control system. In short, it is used to keep track of the history of a project. With Git, you can go back in time to any previous version of your project, or even work on two different versions (or \"branches\") in parallel and \"merge\" them together at some point in the future. We'll stick to using the basic features of Git in DSC 106. There are Git GUIs, and you can use them for this class. You can also use the command-line version of Git. To get started, you'll need to \"clone\" the course repository. The command to do this is: . git clone https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-wi24 . This will copy the repository to a directory on your computer. To bring in the latest version of the repository, run git pull in your local repository. This will not overwrite your work. In fact, Git is designed to make it very difficult to lose work (although it's still possible!). Merge Conflicts . You might face issues when using git pull regarding merge issues and branches. This is caused by files being updated on your side while we are also changing the Git repository by pushing new assignments on our side. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve it: . NOTE: Whenever working with GitHub pulls, merges, etc., it‚Äôs a good idea to save your important work locally so that if you accidentally overwrite your files you still have the work saved. Save your work locally before following the steps below. | git status shows the current state of your Git working directory and staging area. It‚Äôs a good sanity check to start with. You will probably see your project and lab files that you have worked on. | git add . will add all your files to be ready to commit. | git commit -m \"some message of your choice\" will commit the files, with some description in the quotations. This can be whatever you want, it won‚Äôt matter. | . At this stage, if you git pull, it should work. You should double-check that you have new files, as well as that your old files are unchanged. If they are changed then you should be able to just copy-paste from your local backup. If this does not work then you may have merge conflicts, follow the next steps: . | git checkout --theirs [FILENAME] will tell git that whenever a conflict occurs in [FILENAME] to keep your version. Run this for each file with a conflict. | git add [FILENAME] to mark each file with a conflict as resolved. | git rebase --continue or git merge, depending on the setup. | . VS Code . To create, write, and edit our code, we are going to use a code editor. For this class, we are going to provide support for VS Code. If you want to use another code editor, feel free to do so, but keep in mind that we may not be able to recreate the problems that you may run into. You may download VS Code from here. In order to make our lives easier when we develop websites, we are going to use some VS Code extensions. Up to lab 6, it is only necessary to install the following two extensions. Come back when you need to work on lab 6; more information (related to Node installation) will be updated. Prettier . This is an extension that will help us keep our code clean and tidy. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù again to install the extension. Live Preview . This will host a local server in our workspace for us to preview our web pages on. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù again to install the extension. Svelte for VS Code . Starting Lab4, you are going to use Svelte. This will help you with svelte components. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù again to install the extension. ",
